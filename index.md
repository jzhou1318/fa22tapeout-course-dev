## Cheating Policy

If you turn in someone else’s work as if it were your own, you are guilty of cheating.  This includes problem sets, answers on exams, lab exercise checks, project design, and any required course turn-in material.
Also, if you knowingly aid in cheating, you are guilty.
We have software that compares your submitted work to others.
However, it is okay to discuss with others lab exercises and the project (obviously, okay to work with project partner). Okay to discuss homework with others. But everyone must turn in their own work.
Do not post your work on public repositories like github (private o.k.)
If we catch you cheating, you will get negative points on the assignment: It is better to not do the work than to cheat!  If it is a midterm exam, final exam, or final project, you get an F in the class.  All cases of cheating reported to the office of student conduct.
