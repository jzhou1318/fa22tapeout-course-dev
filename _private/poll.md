# Draft Student Background & Interests Poll 

This course will be pretty different from most others you've taken. 
We'll all be doing one big project together - designing and taping out our SoC. 
It's a lot of work, and will require everyone working together. 
This means not everyone will be doing the same work. 
(In fact, if we're doing it right, everyone should be doing *different* work from everyone else.) 

Designing a chip requires a bunch of diverse design-activities, requiring different backgrounds and tools. 
One material example will be between the digital and analog/RF parts of the chip. 

This initial survey is our starting-point for divying up that work. 
It'll focus on your interests and goals for taking the course. 
Don't take it like an exam. It's not. 
Be honest about what you know, how well, and what you'd like to further dig into. 

* Figure: Block Diagram of past chip 
* Introduce it: Small RISC-V CPU, RF, Baseband
  * Do you think you own or use any other chips like this? In what sorts of products? 
  * Which parts of this would you want to work on? 
  * Which parts look like something you've worked on in prior projects or courses? 

* Digital Content 
  * Prior courses in digital circuits 
  * What's the biggest/ most complicated thing you designed, either in these courses or in related projects? 
  * What part of that work was *yours* - you owned it, and really deeply know how it works?
  * Would you call yourself an expert with, user of, or aware of: 
    * (a) Either of the popular digital HDLs (Verilog, VHDL) 
    * (b) Berkeley's home-grown HDL, Chisel

* Analog & RF Content 
  * Prior courses in analog & RF circuits
  * What's the biggest/ most complicated thing you designed, either in these courses or in related projects? 
  * What part of that work was *yours* - you owned it, and really deeply know how it works?
  * Would you call yourself an expert with, user of, or aware of: 
    * (a) Cadence's popular analog-chip design tools
    * (b) Berkeley's home-grown Analog Generator tools (BAG)

* More General 
  * Degree & year 
  * What made you decide to take this course?
